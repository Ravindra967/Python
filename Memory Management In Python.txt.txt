ðŸ§  How does Python manage memory behind the scenes?
 Whether you're a Python beginner or prepping for technical interviews, mastering memory internals can level up your code quality and performance. Here's a quick dive:
ðŸ”¹ Reference Counting â€“ Every object tracks how many references point to it. When the count hits zero, it's deallocated.
ðŸ”¹ Garbage Collection (GC) â€“ Python handles circular references using a generational GC system (gc module).
ðŸ”¹ Common Pitfalls â€“ Memory leaks from unused references, closures, and large uncollected objects.
ðŸ”¹ Optimization Tips:
Use generators over large lists
Apply __slots__ to save memory in classes
Monitor with tracemalloc, sys.getsizeof(), and gc.collect()
ðŸ”§ Want to debug or optimize memory? Tools like objgraph, memory_profiler, and pympler can help!
ðŸ“Œ Understanding these concepts will not only help you write more efficient code but also tackle real-world performance issues.
